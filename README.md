## Getting Started
* To be able to use the Geidea Payment Gateway plugin, you will your merchant credentials (*Public Key* and *API password*).
* You would have received your credentials via the email sent by the enablement team.
* Alternatively, you could log in to the [portal] (https://www.merchant.geidea.net/sa/) and find your *Public Key* and *API Password* under **Payment Gateway** -> **Gateway Settings**
* In case you are unable to find your credentials, you can also contact the support team via our *support channel - * <geideapay.support@geidea.net> or reach out to your point-of-contact who helped with the integration process.

### Note of caution
Your API password is a secret key! It is important to never expose your API password in the front-end of your application. Instead, store your API password securely on the server-side, and use a backend proxy to make API requests on behalf of your frontend application. This approach ensures that your API password is never exposed to the client-side, reducing the risk of unauthorized access and data breaches.
